As users of Emacs and Arch linux will be aware, you can't simply perfect your setup.
There is almost always something that needs tweaking, or something new a likeminded
FOSS-head is working on that you want to try instead. This is all good fun until you
reach the point where it all feels a bit excessive and overly specific to one tool
and you enter a depressive funk about your setup.

This hasn't happened to me before, but it's happening to me now and the following is
my journey to this point and some thoughts on the issue.

## From VIM to VIMWIKI 

When I first switched to Linux from ~~Windows~~ I started using VIM to take notes.
They were simple and written in Markdown. It was very pure and frankly I do miss the
simplicity of it. VIM is very lightweight and this approach required little to no
plugins to be effective.

However as my notes started to grow in quantity and the complexity of each note
evolved (I wanted LaTeX maths and code snippets), I started to look for something
a little bit more. Enter **VimWiki**, a "Personal Wiki for Vim".

VimWiki lets you organise your notes and thoughts into a more structure knowledge base
and this worked for me. I could create different files for everything and navigate
through a file structure I have defined in my markup. I could also maintain to-do lists
and write diary entries.

Sadly, **VimWiki** uses a custom markup language, and although Markdown is supported,
I always felt like it just wasn't quite right. So once again I set out to find something
a little bit more. It wasn't hard to find Emacs, but I wasn't ready for that yet so
I kept on with VimWiki until the summer, when I had far too much time on my hands and
took the plunge into Spacemacs.

## Slowly getting more EVIL (The Spacemacs Era)

- [ ] Discuss spacemacs and transitioning from VIM
- [ ] Adopting org-mode for note taking
	- [ ] Dedicate a section to org-mode advantages discovered at this point
- [ ] Talk about the slow movement of other things like Email and PDF browsing
- [ ] Discuss the move to Doom Emacs (because spacemacs is bloat)
- [ ] Discuss how org-mode became a bigger part of life, agenda, time clocking etc
- [ ] Discuss org-roam
