## A little about my starter

**The Lost Boys**: A few years ago I tried to create a couple of starters from
flour, water and air. These were known as Peter Pain[^fn:1] Mk1 and Mk2. The
fact I tried more than once says it all - making a sourdough starter
from scratch isn't easy. Both sadly never made anything more than a boule or
two, all of which resembled discuses[^fn:2]. So I resorted to plan B.

**Peter Pain Mk3**: Around October 2019 I purchased a small envelope of dried
sourdough starter from John Kirkwood[^fn:3] via his website
[profoodhomemade.com](https://profoodhomemade.com/product/sour-dough-starter/).
I've fed it almost every week and have used it to bake some great bread (if I do
say so myself) and a wide array of other things. It is still going strong and I
highly recommend getting a well established starter if you want to take up
baking sourdough.

## Looking after a Sourdough Starter

I recently changed how I look after my starter and now use a technique called
the scrapings method which I learnt from Bake with Jack[^fn:4]. I have included
both methods below as they both have a use. 

Before getting to the methods, there are a few things that are useful to know
when looking after a starter:

- **How much does your jar weigh?** This can come in handy when feeding the
  starter with either method. By knowing the weight I can put the jar on the
  scales, deduct the jar weight and know how much starter is there. It saves
  decanting starter to a new container to feed.
- **How often are you going to bake?** If you bake more regularly you'll have to
  feed more regularly and may want to keep your starter at room temperature to
  encourage growth. If you bake less frequently (like me) you'll have to feed
  less and should keep your starter in the fridge to slow growth.
- **A liquid on top of your starter isn't a problem.** After 5 days or so, my starter
  usually starts to get a thin layer of liquid. Give it a sniff and it should
  smell sweet and yeasty, this is fine and can be stirred back in before
  discard/feeding.
- **What ratio is your starter?** If you made it yourself you probably know
  this, but the ratio refers to the amount of your starter that is flour versus
  the amount that is water. My starter (and most others) are **1:1**, meaning
  equal parts flour and water.
- **What flour should you use?** I use white bread flour, as this was what my
  starter was made with. If you used a different flour to create your starter,
  feed it with that. 

### What is a Feed?

A feed simply means giving the starter new flour and water so it can continue to
grow. The ratios may vary depending on your answers above, but for me (**1:1**
ratio) I feed as follows:
1. Mix 1 part starter with 2 parts filtered water (doesn't have to be perfectly
   mixed)
2. Add 2 parts flour and mix until no dry flour is visible
3. Scrape down the sides of your container to stop starter drying onto the sides
4. Loosely cover and put in a safe place

This same formula is used for making a levain, which is then used to make bread.


### (\#1) The Scrapings Method

This method is less wasteful since you don't really discard any starter. It also
means you don't have to find a load of recipes to use up your discard and is
very easy to pull off.

1. A day or so before you wish to bake with the starter, feed the starter so
   that it is active. The first time you do this you will have to discard, but
   subsequently you should have the perfect amount for a feed in the jar.
2. On bake day, use the active starter straight from the jar to make your bread.
3. After using the starter for baking, simply scrape down the sides of the jar
   and put it in the fridge ready for next week. 
4. When next week comes around you can start at step one again.

**Example**:
- I need 200g of starter to make my bread. 
- I use 50g of starter plus 100g each of flour and water to make a starter
  on Friday morning. 
- On Saturday I use 200g of the starter to make my bread and make sure to 
  scrape down the sides of the container so my starter doesn't dry out. 
- I have 50g of starter in the fridge ready for next weeks feed.

### (\#2) The Discard Method

This method is great if you want to make lots of things with the discard (more
on that later). It is also useful if you bake less frequently than once a week.
I still use this method when I don't bake in a given week and I need to recharge
my starter, or if I don't use the full amount of starter I made.

1. Weigh the jar with the starter in and deduct the jar weight. This is how much
   starter you have. From this calculate how much to discard.
    - Example: Total weight = 500g and jar weight = 250g, then 
      starter weight = 250g, so discard = 200g to have 50g for feed.
    - Example 2: Total weight = 410g and jar weight = 250g, then
      starter weight = 160g, so discard = 110g to have 50g for feed.
2. "Discard" the amount you calculated.
    - For me this means putting it into a bowl and into the fridge so I can use
      it for something else. You could bag and bin it though if you
      aren't going to use it.
    - You can also use this "discard" to make a levain for baking or if the
      discard is active, even use that directly to bake. 
3. Perform a feed and put the starter back in the fridge.

**Example (No Bake)**: 
- I've not baked in a week and don't plan on baking soon.
- I weigh my starter and calculate that I have 210g.
- I pour 160g into a bowl to make a pancake batter in the morning.
- I feed the remaining 50g to make 250g total and store in the fridge.

**Example (Bake)**:
- I've not baked in a while but plan on baking this weekend.
- I weigh my starter and calculate that I need to discard 200g.
- I use 50g of discard to make a levain on Friday night ready to bake on
  Saturday.
- I use the other 150g to make a spring onion and sesame pancake.
- I feed the 50g in the jar and store in the fridge.

Both methods have a place and I used both when it's needed. I try to waste as
little as possible by using the scrapings method predominantly, but something I
don't bake and need to feed to keep everything alive and that is where the
discard method comes in handy.
