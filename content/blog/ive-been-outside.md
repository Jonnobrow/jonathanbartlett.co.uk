So much has happened since my previous post, so here is the update.

## Life

In my last post I mentioned that I was engaged and planning to buy a house. 

Shortly after that post we started the house hunting process and after nearly
15 months we finally completed on our purchase. Then, just six weeks later, 
**we got married!**

We then spent a couple of weeks taking it slow on Honeymoon in Croatia.

The (nearly) a year since has been great too, we've travelled, made our house
into a home, made memories with friends and family, and found our new normal
after being in a state of flux for a few years.

I talked about wanting to get back into hiking, and while it may not be
hiking, I have been walking more, and exploring the surrounding area.

The plan is to keep travelling and exploring, and we would also like to
adopt/rescue a cat at some point this year üê±. Our garden is the priority at home
this year, and it's been really nice to spend time outside in this unseasonably mild
spring weather.

## Work

Quite a bit has happened here too:

- December 2022: I was promoted to Site Reliability Engineer

- April 2024: The platform I was working on was deprecated and I was moved to a new team

- September 2024: I moved to Sky Protect, and was promoted to Senior SRE

It's been a big change working for Sky Protect, but it's definitely interesting
and a good opportunity for growth, in what is a relatively new team.

## Homelab

My Homelab is really the reason my blog exists, so it gets it's own section.

After I moved house my Homelab became a 24/7 feature again, it even got an upgrade,
with more RAM and some hard-drives. More recently I've ditched K8s and focused
on the few main services I actually use:

- Paperless: Scans / "paper" documents
- Immich: Photos - although I still rely heavily on *Google Photos*
- Nextcloud: File sync

These are all exposed via Traefik reverse proxy and backed-up with Borgmatic to
my Hetzner storage box. It works like a charm, is low maintenance and is simple
enough that I don't have to re-learn everything if I step away for a couple of months.

I'd like to have a "lab" again, but I don't get all that much time to sink into
it at the moment (see [Life](#life)). For now, Home automation is scratching-the-itch. I have Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi 5 (overkill), and have been enjoying
tinkering when I can - all Wife Approved of course!

## Next

I make no promises about when I'll blog next - I guess it will be when I have
another big update to share.

Until next time...
